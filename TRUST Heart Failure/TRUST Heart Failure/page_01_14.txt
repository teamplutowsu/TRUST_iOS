<Content><p><h3>What is my heart function (ejection fraction)?</h3>
Reason for asking this question:<br>
Heart function is commonly
assessed using a number called the ejection fraction. Some people mistakenly believe their ejection fraction indicates the amount of
heart muscle that is still working. The ejection fraction refers to the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the heart each time it beats.
A heart does not pump all of the available blood out each time it beats. A normal heart pumps out or ejects only about 50-65% of the blood inside. If the heart is damaged, the ejection fraction frequently falls below 40%. This is called systolic heart failure. However, you can have a normal ejection fraction and still have heart failure. This may be related to a condition called diastolic heart failure.</p></Content>
