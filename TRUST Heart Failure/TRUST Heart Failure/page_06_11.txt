<li>Ask your family and friends for support. People who have more emotional support from family and friends often are less depressed and anxious. Unfortunately, people who are depressed or anxious tend to isolate themselves. This only makes emotional problems worse. So, reach out to family and friends. Spend more time doing activities you enjoy with them or just have a meal or a conversation together.</li>
