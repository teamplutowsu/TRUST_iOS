First, talk to your doctor or nurse before starting an exercise program. Then:<br>
<ul>
<li>Start very slowly and steadily increase your activity level.</li>
<li>Build a routine for your activity schedule. For example, you may want to walk every evening before dinner.</li>
<li>Think of your activity or exercise as a special time to do something good for yourself. Schedule it several times a week. Stick to it just as you would an important date.</li>
<li>Walk, swim, or bicycle with a family member or friend to make it more fun.</li>
</ul>
