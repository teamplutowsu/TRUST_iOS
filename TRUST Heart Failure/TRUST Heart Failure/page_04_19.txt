It is important to tend to your symptoms as soon as they begin. Like many people, you may fail to notice symptoms in their early stages, or you may shrug them off. But, ignoring symptoms is risky. Symptoms such as trouble breathing, ankle swelling, or weight gain can mean that your heart failure is getting worse. Also, heart failure can get worse “silently.” So if you notice any change in your symptoms (even if the changes are mild) take them seriously. These symptoms can quickly lead to urgent problems requiring a hospital stay.
