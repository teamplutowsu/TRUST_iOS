<Subtitle>Questions to Ask Your Doctor or Nurse</Subtitle>
<Content><p>
Reason for asking this question:<br> 
Some patients can monitor their heart failure symptoms well and can tell when they need a little higher dose of their water pill. They are in tune with their bodies, weigh themselves routinely, and pay close attention to changes in their symptoms.<br>
If you also do these things, your doctor may direct you to take an extra diuretic (water pill) when you gain a specified amount of weight.<br>
Do not do this on your own, because the regimen varies for every person. But, if you believe that you are a candidate for a flexible diuretic (water pill) regimen, ask your doctor.
